uimaFIT S4 SDK
================

This SDK provides access to the [S4][4] text analytics services by using it to construct text processing pipelines programmatically
with [uimaFIT][3] - an Apache UIMA sub project aimed at delivering easy ways to configure, run and test UIMA pipelines without bothering
constructing them through GUIs. The S4 Annotator uimaFIT component does not have any requirements or assumptions about the type of 
pre-processing or post-processing of the textual data being annotated.
